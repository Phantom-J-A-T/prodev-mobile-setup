I searched for the Expo Go app directly on my Android Playstore and I found it immediately with no stress 
I have installed it and it has the option of scanning QR  codes without  login in so depending on how it is I will decide whether to 
Log into the app or to usue it like that but since the login has the option of accessing previous works I will probably do that
